# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for EMNIST Letter Reconstruction

![Icon_2](icon_2.png)

## Project Overview

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model used for learning latent representations of data. In this project, a VAE is implemented to reconstruct EMNIST (Extended Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) letters. The VAE learns to encode the underlying structure of the EMNIST dataset and generates new samples similar to the training data.

## Problem Statement

The problem involves reconstructing handwritten letters from the EMNIST dataset using a VAE. Given the variability and complexity of handwritten characters, reconstructing them accurately poses a challenging problem in computer vision and pattern recognition.

## Application

VAEs have various applications in machine learning and computer vision:

1. **Data Generation**: VAEs can generate new samples from a learned latent space distribution, making them useful for generating synthetic data for training other models.

2. **Anomaly Detection**: By reconstructing input data, VAEs can detect anomalies or outliers that deviate significantly from the learned distribution.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: VAEs learn a low-dimensional representation of the input data, enabling efficient storage and visualization of high-dimensional data.

4. **Image Compression**: VAEs can compress images by encoding them into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decoding them back to the original space.

5. **Feature Learning**: VAEs learn meaningful features of the input data, which can be used for downstream tasks such as classification or clustering.


## Solution

### Preprocessing EMNIST Dataset

The EMNIST dataset is preprocessed to prepare it for training. This involves data cleaning, normalization, and partitioning into training and testing sets.

### Building the Tensor Graph

The architecture of the VAE is defined, including the encoder and decoder networks. The VAE model is trained using TensorFlow, optimizing a loss function that balances reconstruction accuracy and latent space regularization.

### Dropout for Regularization

Dropout regularization is applied to the VAE model to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. Dropout randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.

## Tools Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Data Preprocessing Techniques Utilized

- Normalization
- Train-test Split
- Data Cleaning

## Embedding

The VAE learns a low-dimensional embedding of the EMNIST letters, capturing the essential features necessary for reconstruction.

## Optimizers

The Adam optimizer is employed to minimize the VAE's reconstruction loss and KL divergence, efficiently updating the model's parameters during training.

## Crossfold

Crossfold validation is not applicable in this project as the dataset is pre-partitioned into training and testing sets.
